# WEmoji - WhatsApp/iOS Emojis for Pidgin #

The original iOS emojis used by WhatsApp and their unicode counterparts. Perfect to be used with [whatsapp-purple](https://github.com/davidgfnet/whatsapp-purple).
## How to use ##
Simply choose one size (i prefer 24px) and put the choosen folder in your `~/.purple/smileys` (On Microsoft Windows: `%appdata%\.purple\smileys`). Go to Tools->Preferences->Themes and select your new smiley theme. Done!

For more information see [the pidgin wiki](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/SmileyThemes).

## Versions ##
- 10/30/2015 - Added Emojis with skin tone modifier.
- 10/14/2015 - First version. Checked against WhatsApp 2.12.309

## TODOs (low priority) ##
- There are still some mistakes due to file generation (e.g. 1f44d is 'thumbs up' but the current assigned alias e00e is nothing in WhatsApp)
- A better order of Emojis (maybe same as original) would be helpful
- Using multiple (especially skin colored) Emojis without spaces between them sometimes shows them as squares. Is this a problem of Pidgin itself?
